# 🏠 Smart Home System Simulation (Arduino + Tinkercad)

This project simulates a Smart Home system using Arduino UNO and Tinkercad Circuits.  
It includes light control with a push button, a temperature-based fan, and a password-protected door lock using a keypad and servo.

## 🔧 Features
- Light control via push button
- Fan activated by TMP36 temperature sensor (>30°C)
- Password-controlled servo door lock using keypad
- Fully simulated on Tinkercad (no hardware needed)

## 🧰 Tools
- Arduino UNO
- Tinkercad Circuits
- Components: LED, DC Motor, TMP36, Servo, Keypad
